      <description>Lately I had to update my CV and stumbled on a little old problem.
Being italian mothertongue I had two different version of my CV, one in italian and one in english.
This made tedious making edits, mainly because each time that I&amp;rsquo;ve added a line on the file I realized there were other places where an update was needed.
Remove a line here, move this section there, repeat for the other file.</description>

      <description>(A semi-serious movie test)
TL;DR The Bicycle Test is passed by a movie if it satisfies one condition:
there must exist at least one scene in which a named character rides a bike.
 Some time ago i discovered the Bechdel test, a test born as a joke about the representation of women in fiction.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found it pretty terrifying, as even with those banal conditions lots of movies doesn&amp;rsquo;t pass it.</description>
