<p>(A semi-serious movie test)</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>The Bicycle Test is passed by a movie if it satisfies one condition:</p>

<p><em>there must exist at least one scene in which a named character rides a bike.</em></p>

<h2 id="so">So&hellip;</h2>

<p>Some time ago i discovered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test">Bechdel test</a>,
a test born as a joke about the representation of women in fiction.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found it pretty terrifying, as even with those banal conditions lots of
movies doesn&rsquo;t pass it.</p>

<p>On the other side, in spite of the climate crisis, in fiction private cars
represents pretty much the only accepted way of moving around.</p>

<p>This test do exists for answering the question: is <em>in some way</em> an alternative
mobility represented?</p>
