            <title>Maintaining a Multilingual CV in LaTeX</title>

            <description>Lately I had to update my CV and stumbled on a little old problem.
Being italian mothertongue I had two different version of my CV, one in italian and one in english.
This made tedious making edits, mainly because each time that I&amp;rsquo;ve added a line on the file I realized there were other places where an update was needed.
Remove a line here, move this section there, repeat for the other file.</description>

<p>Being italian mothertongue I had two different version of my CV, one in italian
and one in english.</p>
<p>This made tedious making edits, mainly because each time that I&rsquo;ve added a line
on the file I realized there were other places where an update was needed.</p>
<p>Remove a line here, move this section there, repeat for the other file.</p>
<p>Errr&hellip;.What I&rsquo;ve moved where?</p>
<p>My solution, while pretty hacky, is to maintain only one file with both
translations paired, line by line; for achieving this I&rsquo;ve written a simple
command, defined as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="color:#75715e">% switch language from lang 1 to lang 2 changing the number after #
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">\newcommand</span>{<span style="color:#66d9ef">\lan</span>}[2]{#1}
</code></pre></div><p>A complete example of a document in two languages would be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="color:#66d9ef">\documentclass</span>{article}
<span style="color:#75715e">% switch language from lang 1 to lang 2 changing the number after #
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">\newcommand</span>{<span style="color:#66d9ef">\lan</span>}[2]{#1}

<span style="color:#66d9ef">\begin</span>{document}
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">\lan</span>{Hello World!}{Salve, mondo!}
<span style="color:#66d9ef">\end</span>{document}
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>\lan</code> command defined on line 3 gets two parameters and outputs the first;
in this case, the document&rsquo;s first language is english.</p>
<p>The output will be just a document containting &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you change the <code>\lan</code> command and instead of <code>#1</code> you put <code>#2</code>, you&rsquo;ll
magically get the line &ldquo;Salve, mondo!&rdquo;, the italian version of hello world.</p>
<p>Ok, this is not perfect: every time you want to change language you must edit
the command, and also the compilation won&rsquo;t automatically generate different
pdf based on the language.</p>
<p>But at least you&rsquo;ll have only one file to edit.</p>
<h5 id="ps">P.s.</h5>
<p>If instead of
<code>[2]</code> we define the command with  <code>[3]</code> we&rsquo;ll be able to obtain a document in
three languages, as long as the command is used with three pairs of braces
instead of two (one per language).</p>
<p>We can increment the number of languages as much as we want, but the code
readability will drop.</p>

            <description>(A semi-serious movie test)
TL;DR The Bicycle Test is passed by a movie if it satisfies one condition:
there must exist at least one scene in which a named character rides a bike.
 Some time ago i discovered the Bechdel test, a test born as a joke about the representation of women in fiction.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found it pretty terrifying, as even with those banal conditions lots of movies doesn&amp;rsquo;t pass it.</description>

<p>The Bicycle Test is passed by a movie if it satisfies one condition:</p>
<p><em>there must exist at least one scene in which a named character rides a bike.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Some time ago i discovered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test">Bechdel test</a>,
a test born as a joke about the representation of women in fiction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found it pretty terrifying, as even with those banal conditions lots of
movies doesn&rsquo;t pass it.</p>
<p>On the other side, in spite of the climate crisis, in fiction private cars
represents pretty much the only accepted way of moving around.</p>
<p>This test do exists for answering the question: is <em>in some way</em> an alternative
mobility represented?</p>
